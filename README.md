# SurvivalGame
Survival rouge game written with only pygame, no images

## Next Steps
1. Fix config.py Config class... needs more research
2. Change enemy spawn. Create functional waves
3. Add item drops. Maybe have powerups like cod zombies?
4. Create a working menu. Have game play itself in the background. For optimisation probably create new game class
5. Create settings page. Allow player to make their own controls and have that write back to json. Also variable frame rate and window size.
6. Create some kind of circular attack
7. Create new enemy, mage of sorts. Maybe buff the enemies?
8. Create boss
9. have enemy's stats scale according to wave.
10. OPTIMISE. Have every calculation that needs to be done in class/instance setup.
11. Create better health detection for enemies instead of quadrants.
12. Create status icons. might have to use pixel art
13. Determine how to stagger attacks.
14. Lightning attack.
15. Dash Upgrades
16. Currency for levelling outside of game 1 per x enemies + 1 for boss
17. Different characters/starting abilities
18. Attack upgrades (rather than showing same attack twice)


## Enemy ideas
1. Mage: Shield allies, debuff hero, low health but is smart
2. Dash: dashes towards when close enough
3. Dart: Moves unpredictably diagonally. Can be stunned by projectiles?
4. Boss: lots of health. Can summon?
5. Ranged: Bolts, Ranged spells


## Power Ideas
1. Lightning
2. Area spells (random)
3. Area spells (mouse targeted)
4. Character field
5. Multiplayer only ideas?

## Character Upgrades
