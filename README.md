# SurvivalGame
Survival rouge game written with pygame

## Next Steps
1. Change enemy spawn. There will be waves so perhaps create a wave class?
2. Change how status effects calculate damage
3. Create dmg function for enemies to player
4. Add item drops. Maybe have powerups like cod zombies?
5. Create a working menu. Have game play itself in the background. For optimisation probably create new game class
6. Create settings page. Allow player to make their own controls and have that write back to json. Also variable frame rate and window size.
7. Create some kind of circular attack
8. Create new enemy, mage of sorts. Maybe buff debuff the enemies?
9. Create boss
10. have enemy's stats scale according to wave.
11. OPTIMISE. Have every calculation that needs to be done in class/instance setup.
12. Create better health detection for enemies instead of quadrants.
13. Create status icons. might have to use pixel art
14. Determine how to stagger attacks.
15. Lightning attack.
